# QuIDE: Quantum Integrated Development Environment

QuIDE is an open-source platform designed to streamline the development and testing of quantum computing algorithms and applications. It combines a user-friendly graphical interface, a powerful quantum simulator, and an extensive library of pre-built quantum components and templates.

## Features

- Graphical Quantum Circuit Designer
- Quantum Simulator
- Quantum Algorithm Library
- Quantum Compiler and Optimizer
- Hardware Abstraction Layer
- Learning Resources and Community Support

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up a development environment to start building QuIDE.

### Prerequisites

To start building QuIDE, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Qiskit
- Cirq
- Pennylane
- (Optional) A desktop framework like Qt or GTK for building the graphical interface

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuIDE.git
cd QuIDE
`

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

\```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
\```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

\```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\```

4. (Optional) Install the desktop framework of your choice for building the graphical interface.

## Development

1. Develop the core quantum simulator, compiler, and optimizer in the `quide` directory.
2. Implement the graphical interface for designing quantum circuits using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) or desktop frameworks (e.g., Qt, GTK) in the `gui` directory.
3. Create the hardware abstraction layer and integrate with popular quantum computing platforms in the `hal` directory.
4. Develop a library of pre-built quantum algorithms and components in the `library` directory.
5. Compile learning resources, tutorials, and sample projects in the `docs` and `examples` directories.
6. Set up a community forum or collaboration platform for users.
